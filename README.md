# tarkov_bot_js
Bot for Tarkov. I was banned in this game, but I'm not sure if this is because of the bot. I just did a really big stupid thing (not related to using a bot).
The bot uses [this library](https://github.com/matias-kovero/tarkov)

# Use
1. To use, add environment variables to the system:
* hwid - Hardware ID
* email - Account email
* password - Account password

If you need telegram notifications add:
* telegram_token - Telegram bot token
* telegram_chat_id - Telegram chat id

2. Create the items.js file (sample content can be found in the project)
3. Enjoy
